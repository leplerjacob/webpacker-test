Using Loaders

Loaders used so far: style-loader, css-loader


1.) Loaders allow other file types to be included in the webpacker bundled file

2.) Loaders will be processed in reversed order of mention in a webpacker file

3.) Dealing with styling, style-loader must be first, followed by css-loader
