Substitutions

1.) When code splitting is employed and multiple bundles are created, substitutions may be used to keep filenames unique in both a dynamic or static way

2.) substitutions are bracketed strings within the declaration og entry point filenames

    output: {
        filename: '[name].bundle.js'
        filename: '[id].bundle.js'
        filename: '[name].[contenthash].bundle.js'
    }

3.) [contenthash] generates a unique hash for the filename

Boilerplate

1.) Webpack includes a boilerplate, which is responsible for the change in filename when incorporating contenthash in the output filename
