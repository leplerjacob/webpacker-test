1.) Codesplitting can allow to split code into various bundles, which can then be loaded on demand or parallel

Different ways to accomplish, one is explicitly declaring how to split

1.) By declaring different entry points for separate files, more than one bundle can be created. However, duplication of dependencies will occur.

Prevent duplication

1.) use dependOn option for entry points. options can be declared by making the entry point key-value's value as a object {import:, dependOn:} and give it the option of dependOn:'shared'

2.) If multiple entry points on single html file, use optimization option in webpack config file and set to 'single'

Entry points

1.) Instead of declaring more than one entry point, you can use a single entry that can then import more than one file

    entry: {page: ['./analytics', './app'] }

    instead of...

    index: {
      import: "./src/index.js",
      dependOn: "shared",
    },
    another: {
      import: "./src/another-module.js",
      dependOn: "shared",
    },

2.)
